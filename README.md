# Investigation of the spin dependence of the Møller-Plesset adiabatic connection for one electron systems.
A code used to calculate the hydrogen atom with different fractional spins along the Møller Plesset Adiabatic Connection using the finite difference spectral renormalisation algorithm.

Depends on the following packages:
- [numpy]
- [scipy]
- [matplotlib]
- [sympy]
- [argparse]

## Known Issues:
None

## Future implementations:
1. Allow for complex \lambda's, energies and wavefunctions.
